2. Computer Architecture Parctice (Cache coherenace, Out of order execution, Pipelining, ALU design, MAC design etc).
3. ASIC-VLSI Topics (CDC Synchronizers, FIFOs, STA, High Speed Designs, Low Power Designs - Clock and Power Gating).
4. Verilog/SystemVerilog + FSM topics (Palindromes, Multiplier design, LRU design, CRC checks, One-Hot vs Gray Encoding, Barrel Shifters).
5. Verification Methedologies + UVM.
6. Communication Protocols (SPI, UART, PCIe, CAN, AMBA/AXI, Synchronous vs Asynchronous data transfer, Parallel vs Serial Communication).
